How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

diff showed the lines in the files that were different from each other, inspecting these lines helped us find the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Well you could figure out what kind of error are proned to come up through the process of programming from scratch and avoid hose errors in future endeavours.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

pros:only save correct codes or checkpoints that work
cons:might lose important work if not saved automatically

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is used for a whole project, a whole project might require a whole load of files for the project to work properly. Google docs is for a single file and therfore only saves a single file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log give the comment on the change made on the file usually a new feature included or a bug fixed. using that commit id we can call the command git diff to see the actual lines that differ.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

we could always go back to the old version that works using the git checkout command,we can even find out the error and change it

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

basically for projects
